This repository contains many knowledge, works and everything needed to dump and build new OS or tools for ATS3603-based devices.

Especially trials to create pure OS/2 and Linux distributions for OS / 2 - UCOS ATS SOC-devices.

## üñ•Ô∏è Device Information

![Schematic](pwkdy_shematic.png)

> PowKiddy V90 body schematic / CC: PowKiddy


The devices are "handhelds", branded as ***V90***, ***X20 Mini*** and ***Powkiddy J6/X6***. They are sold under different names, designs and form factors, but always with same hardware.

I pay attention to this handheld because of its amazing price-quality-components ratio. You can get this entire device for **$20(!)** (in the: 2022/2023).

The biggest trade-off in the device`s price is probably the used released in year 2006 processor: **Actions ATS3603**... 
which makes it weird, but also very interesting!

## üóúÔ∏è Hardware Specification

The Actions ATS3603 handhelds may look different, but inside they are almost the same.

The Informations that we have obtained:

| Part | Description |
|-----|-----------------|
| CPU | Actions Semiconductor ATS3603 (Actions ATS3603) |
| RAM | 64 MB DDR SDRAM Hynix HY5DU121622CTP |
| Display | 4.3"LCD 800x480 |
| Battery | 3.7V 1200mA |
| Internal Storage | 16MB W25Q128 SPI NOR |
| External Storage | Micro SD (Max: 64GB) |
| Controls | 12 Buttons: L-Thumbstick, L-DPad, J-Buttons (A, B, X, Y), L1 and R1 (0-1) Triggers, Start, Select, Vol+, Vol- [+ Switch (ON/OFF)]  |
| Audio | 3.5 Jack (Stereo), Built-In Speaker (Mono). Microphone |
| OS | MicroC/OS-II / UCOS - from distributors and hackers |
| Connection | Mini USB  (Charging: 4.75V-5.25V) |

As usual not a lot is known about the internal of this SOC, some
progress about [reversing its boot process](mbrec.md) are in the way.

## üü¶ Display 

The display units used in the Actions handhelds are technically always the same.

These are: **800x480 20 PIN FFC TFT**. 

You can easily get them to live with another board using **SSD1963** driver with flip-lock FFC connector and basic setup. If you want to pair it with Arduino, you can use the ***UTFT*** library which has out-of-the-box compatibility with these dislpays.


There is obviously no digitizer, but if you want to mount one - there are also no problem. Small life-hack to keep the display good price is to choose the *JIAANKEJI* (factory specialized in touch panels for car dashboards, with wide range of models - as capacitive as resistive) panel with 4 FPC, without driver board/chip for ~$5 and implement it.

 If you don`t care about the costs and want a more complex solution, you can choose one from the leading digitizer producers like *Yunlea* or *Goodix*.

## üßÆ Reversing the MBREC Flash Dump

<details>


The flash dump is analyzed has the following md5

```
716c4263fb7ca44cd3606ab1874c06eb
```

since it's in the ``SPI`` flash and the actual user data is in
the SD card it's assumed that the former remains untouched
and varies only in a new revision.

```

(where you note the ``ActBrm`` signature at the end), we have at the start
a jump to offset ``0x28``

```
ram:00000000               09 00 00 10     b                  FUN_00000028
ram:00000004               00 00 00 00     _nop
```

Where the real startup happens; ``ghidra`` tries its best to come up 
with something useful (below you can see the result after some reworking)

```c
void FUN_00000028(void)

{
  int iVar1;
  undefined4 s;
  dword *start;
  undefined4 *_dst;
  undefined4 *end;
  undefined4 *dst;
  
  _DAT_b001801c = 1;
  (*(code *)0xb4060400)(0x200,0x1e00,0xb4062a00);
  iVar1 = func_0x04060128(0xb4062a00,0x1e00);
  if (iVar1 == 0) {
    uRamb4060000 = 0x55aa5a5a;
    _DAT_b0220008 = 0xffff;
    func_0x04062a00();
  }
  (*(code *)0xb4060400)();
  uRamb4067ffc = (*(code *)0xb4060400)();
  start = (undefined4 *)&DAT_bfc05000;
  if (_DAT_bfc00008 != 0x630b) {
    start = (undefined4 *)&DAT_bfc05400;
  }
  end = start + 0x7ff;
  uRamb4067ffc = uRamb4067ffc | 0x20000000;
  dst = (undefined4 *)0xb4066000;
  do {
    _dst = dst;
    s = *start;
    start = start + 1;
    *_dst = s;
    dst = _dst + 1;
  } while (start != end);
  /* WARNING: Could not recover jumptable at 0x00000120. Too many branches */
  /* WARNING: Treating indirect jump as call */
  (*(code *)(_dst + -0x7fe))();
  return;
}
```

Seeing also the remaining part of the code seems that this code
will be loaded around address ``0xb406xxxx`` but if you use the
``0000`` as the starting address you quickly realize that something
doesn't match up: in particular the function at ``0xb4060400`` that
is in the middle of a well defined function.

With some experimentation around offsets the most plausible address is
``0xb4062a00`` that is the argument passed at the "not-matching-function":
my educated guess is that the function is loading, starting from offset ``0x200``
``0x1e00`` bytes (up to the partitions) at address ``0xb4062a00``, check something and then jump
to that address.

Since at offset ``0x128`` there is a function that is recognizable as a form of ``crc``

```c

int crc(dword *addr,int offset)

{
  bool bVar1;
  dword *ptr;
  short c;
  
  ptr = (dword *)((int)addr + offset + -4);
  c = 0;
  if (*(short *)ptr == 0x55aa) {
    do {
      c = c + *(short *)ptr;
      bVar1 = ptr != addr;
      ptr = (dword *)((int)ptr + -2);
    } while (bVar1);
    if (c == *(short *)((int)addr + offset + -2)) {
      return 0;
    }
  }
  return 1;
}

```

I'm assuming that at very start of the bootup process, the first 512 bytes 
of the flash are loaded at address ``0xb4060000``
with some other routines at address ``0xb4060400`` and then happens what is described above.

**Note:** the stack pointer is set at address ``0xb4067f00``, obviously the decompiler
cannot show that in ``C``.

**TL;DR:** in ``ghidra`` load the flash dump at ``0xb4062800``, probably there exists a
routine that move the flash data at that address and then jump to execute the
function at ``0xb4062a00``.

It's interesting this note in the
[rockbox's wiki](https://www.rockbox.org/wiki/ATJ213xFirmware#Booting_sequence) about the boot sequence
of the ``ATJ213x``:

    On power on the CPU begin execution at VA=0xbfc00000 (PA=0x1fc00000) where BROM
    is mapped. BROM loads MBRCF*.BIN stored at the beginning of nand flash into iram
    (VA=0xb4040000, PA=0x14040000), check signature and checksum and passes control
    to the just loaded code. MBRCF* initializes caches, clocks, DRAM, loads BREC*
    loader to the DRAM (VA=0x80000000, PA=0x00000000) and passes control to the
    BREC. BREC checks logical structure of flash, loads and passes control to uCOS
    kernel. If at any stage of load chain en error is encountered 'Hard DFU' handler
    stored at 0xbfc05400 (0x1ffc bytes) in BROM is copied to 0xb4046800 and CPU
    jumps to this handler.

in particular this last part seems that code after the failing of the ``crc`` check.

### Loading Partitions

Now starts the business: it's a little difficult to describe the code so what
follows is a description of some important functions

At offset ``0x1254`` there is a function that reuses the original function
at ``0xb4060400``

```c
void map_sectors(int offset,dword *address,int length)

{
  FUN_b4060400(offset << 9,length << 9,(dword)address);
  return;
}
```

and it seems to use a **sector** as a unit (here it's implied that 512 bytes
is the size of such unit).

This function is used to start mapping the partition descriptions found at the offset ``0x2000``.
Then the checksum is calculated and compared with the value at ``0x23f4``.

Another important function is

```c
int load_partition_type(int type,dword **callback)

{
  dword *address;
  uint checksum;
  int ret;
  uint index;
  uint next_index;
  
  index = 0;
  while( true ) {
    next_index = index + 1;
    if (*(char *)&PARTITION_ADDRESS[index].type == type) break;
    index = next_index;
    if (0x1e < next_index) {
      *callback = NULL;
      return -1;
    }
  }
  map_sectors(PARTITION_ADDRESS[index].offset,&MEM_TMP_START,1);
  address = (dword *)tlb_configure_for_type
                               (type,DWORD_b4064c08,
                                ((MEM_TMP_END - MEM_TMP_START) + 0x203 >> 9) +
                                (PARTITION_ADDRESS[index].size >> 9));
  *callback = address;
  ret = -3;
  if (address != NULL) {
    map_sectors(PARTITION_ADDRESS[index].offset,address,
                PARTITION_ADDRESS[index].size >> 9);
    checksum = checksum_plus((byte *)*callback,PARTITION_ADDRESS[index].size,4);
    if (PARTITION_ADDRESS[index].checksum != checksum) {
      *callback = NULL;
      return -2;
    }
    zero((byte *)MEM_TMP_START,MEM_TMP_END);
    ret = 0;
    *callback = (dword *)MEM_CALLBACK;
  }
  return ret;
}
```

(edited to remove useless parameters); in practice it takes a partition identified
by a specific **type**, it maps it and returns the entry point of the loaded module.

The ``tlb_configure_for_type()`` configures the ``MMU`` and for this level of analysis
it's not important.

At this point the code is loading the module "startup.bin" and after that the module
named "brecf03.bin" with the following array of arguments:

 - the index of the ``TLB``(?)
 - the address where the calling module has been loaded (our ``0xb4062a00``)
 - some hardcoded address, probably read only data
 - some unidentified value
 - the entry point of the "storage.bin" module (mapped just before this)
 - the ``tlb_configure_for_type()`` address

## Partitions

At offset ``0x2000`` we see a block that resembles a partition
following this organization in memory:

```c
struct partition_t {
	char label[12];
	uint32_t type;
	uint32_t _unknown;
	uint32_t block_offset; /* block size of 512 bytes */
	uint32_t size; /* in bytes */
	uint32_t checksum; /* to be confirmed */
};
```

From each section of the partition is possible to extract raw binaries (that we'll call "modules"
in the following) that have
a common "header" (the first four dwords) with information about their loading:

 - upper limit of the memory used
 - max extension of memory needed
 - base address
 - entry point

A couple of them register syscalls using as slot their type identifier

| Label           | Description     | load address   | type |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|------|
| ``brecf03.bin`` | boot record ??? | ``0xc3080000`` | 0    |
| ``welcome.bin`` |                 |                | 1    |
| ``card.bin``    | mmc driver      | ``0xc0700000`` | 2    |
| ``storage.bin`` | SPI NOR driver  | ``0xc30a0000`` | 3    |
| ``upg.bin``     | upgrade code    | ``0xc0400000`` | 5    |
| ``lcd.bin``     | lcd driver      | ``0xc0f00000`` | 8    |
| ``startup.bin`` | bootstrap ?     | ``0xb4064e00`` | 9    |
| ``fb.bin``      | framebuffer ??? | ``0xc0200000`` | 0xa  |
| ``shutoff.bin`` | shutoff :)      | `` ``          | 0xc  |
| ``key.bin``     | read keypress   | ``0xc0d00000`` | 0xd  |
| ``mfp.bin``     | multifunction   | ``0xc0280000`` | 0x16 |

This extracted modules are only a little portion of the total content of the
flash, at ``0xb40c0000`` (offset ``0x80000``, 512KB) starts something else.

From the entropy graph generated by ``binwalk``

![entropy](entropy.png)

we can assume that such content is encrypted/compressed.

## ``startup.bin``

It's the first called from the bootloader, it seems to check some configuration
strings and when are found use this to setup GPIOs accordingly.

## ``brecf03.bin``

The most important is the ``brec`` one, it sets a jump table at address
``0xc3080e00`` that is called from the other binaries to perform common service;
take note that the tenth entry is the ``log`` function!

## ``storage.bin``

It's loaded by ``brec`` and from the code contained into it is possible to
deduce that the memory mapping assigned for the SPI NOR memory starts at ``0xb0258000``.

Moreover also the GPIOs are probably more than the ``A`` and ``B`` set since a couple
of addresses are called from this module.

It seems also using some ``DMA`` transactions; the memory mapping for it starts at ``0xb0220000``
with channel width of 32 bytes.

The important characteristic of this module is that, when requested operations involving sectors
starting from ``0x400`` (i.e. ``0x80000`` bytes) the data is "encoded"

```c
void _decode(byte *buffer,dword *seed,uint offset,short size)

{
  int16_t index3;
  uint32_t seed7;
  uint32_t tmp;
  int16_t index;
  int16_t index2;
  uint32_t key [8];
  uint32_t *_buffer;
  
  key[0] = KEY[0];
  key[1] = KEY[1];
  key[2] = KEY[2];
  key[3] = KEY[3];
  key[4] = KEY[4];
  key[5] = KEY[5];
  key[6] = KEY[6];
  key[7] = KEY[7];
  _buffer = (uint32_t *)buffer;
  if (((uint)buffer & 3) != 0) {
    _buffer = RANDOM_INIT;
    sys_memcpy(RANDOM_INIT,buffer,0x200);
  }
  for (index = 0; index < 8; index = index + 1) {
    key[index] = key[index] ^ 0x5a << (offset & 0x1f) ^ seed[index];
  }
  seed7 = seed[7];
  for (index2 = 0; index2 < size; index2 = index2 + 1) {
    index3 = (int16_t)((int)index2 << 3);
    _buffer[index3] = _buffer[index3] ^ key[1];
    key[0] = key[1];
    _buffer[index3 + 1] = _buffer[index3 + 1] ^ key[2];
    key[1] = key[2];
    _buffer[index3 + 2] = _buffer[index3 + 2] ^ key[3];
    key[2] = key[3];
    tmp = key[3] ^ key[5];
    _buffer[index3 + 3] = _buffer[index3 + 3] ^ key[4];
    key[3] = key[4];
    _buffer[index3 + 4] = _buffer[index3 + 4] ^ key[5];
    key[4] = key[5];
    _buffer[index3 + 5] = _buffer[index3 + 5] ^ key[6];
    key[5] = key[6];
    _buffer[index3 + 6] = _buffer[index3 + 6] ^ key[7];
    key[6] = key[7];
    _buffer[index3 + 7] = _buffer[index3 + 7] ^ tmp;
    key[7] = _buffer[index3 + 7] ^ seed7;
  }
  if (((uint)buffer & 3) != 0) {
    sys_memcpy(buffer,_buffer,0x200);
  }
  return;
}
```

Use [decrypt.c](decrypt.c) to extract such part of the file from the flash dump.

## ``upg.bin``

It looks for ``/mnt/udisk/us227a.upg``, probably the code indicates the specific
version of ``SDK`` used to build the system.
